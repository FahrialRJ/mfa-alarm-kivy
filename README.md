# MFA Alarm - Wake-Up Alarm with Multi-Factor Challenges

MFA Alarm is a desktop alarm program developed using Python Kivy. It is designed not just to wake users up, but to ensure they are fully alert by requiring them to pass face verification and math verification. This program has several features:

- Set alarm time
- Face and eye detection using OpenCV and webcam to verify wakefulness
- Math quiz challenge after facial verification
- Looping alarm sound using Pygame until both verifications are passed
